### 🔬 Key Projects for Internship Review

My pinned repositories showcase my diverse skill set. I ensure my projects demonstrate key concepts valuable to a team:

* **Live Data & Streaming (e.g., IP TV App):** Demonstrating complex state management and high-performance rendering.
* **API & Geolocation (e.g., City Weather App):** Focusing on third-party API integration, robust error handling, and clean data fetching.
* **Real-time Database & Auth (e.g., Chat Application):** Showcasing Firebase integration, real-time data listeners, and secure authentication flow.

I ensure my projects demonstrate:
1. **Clean Code:** Adherence to Dart linting rules and separation of concerns (e.g., using layered architecture).
2. **State Management:** Practical application of the **Provider** package for managing complex UI and data flow. 
3. **API Integration:** Handling asynchronous data fetching, error states, and local caching.
4. **Responsive UI:** Applications that adapt well across different screen sizes.

> **Note:** Each project repository includes a comprehensive `README.md` with **Screenshots/GIFs** and clear **Setup Instructions** for easy review.
