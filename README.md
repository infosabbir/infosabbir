# Hi there! I'm Md Sabbir Ahammed 👋

### Mobile Developer | Flutter Enthusiast

I'm a passionate and detail-oriented Mobile Application Developer based in **Narayanganj, Dhaka, Bangladesh**. I specialize in **Flutter** and **Dart**, focusing on transforming design concepts into high-performance, beautiful, and user-friendly cross-platform applications (iOS, Android, and Web).

My goal is to constantly learn, build robust applications, and secure a **Flutter Internship** opportunity to contribute my skills to a professional team.

### 🚀 Key Projects for Internship Review

I am actively building a portfolio of projects to showcase my diverse skill set. My pinned repositories will feature apps like:

* **Live Data & Streaming (e.g., IP TV App):** Demonstrating complex state management and high-performance rendering.

* **API & Geolocation (e.g., City Weather App):** Focusing on third-party API integration, robust error handling, and clean data fetching.

* **Real-time Database & Authentication (e.g., Chat Application):** Showcasing Firebase integration, real-time data listeners, and secure authentication flow.

I ensure my projects demonstrate:

1. **Clean Code:** Adherence to Dart linting rules and separation of concerns (e.g., using layered architecture).

2. **State Management:** Practical application of Riverpod/Provider/BLoC for managing complex UI and data flow.

3. **API Integration:** Handling asynchronous data fetching, error states, and local caching.

4. **Responsive UI:** Applications that adapt well across different screen sizes.
